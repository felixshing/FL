# Reimplementation of FedAWS 
This is a reimplementation of FedAWS (Federated Learning with Only Positive Labels, ICML 2020) in PyTorch. 
The reimplementation algorithm comes from [FedRepo](https://github.com/lxcnju/FedRepo).

## Running Tips
Just use `python train_lab.py` then you can run FedAWS under cifar-10 dataset.
You can change hyperparameters in `train_lab.py`.

## Datasets
Only cifar-10 is on this repo. But you can also use cifar-100 and FaMNIST datasets after you download them.
